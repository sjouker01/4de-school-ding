We tend to turn to air conditioning to solve these problems, but that uses up a lot of electricity.\nA team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have an idea: stack the same cooling techniques we’ve been using for thousands of years by harnessing the power of aerogel.\nNo power, no emissions…no problem?"
