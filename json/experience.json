            A team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have an idea: stack the same cooling techniques we’ve been using for thousands of years by harnessing the power of aerogel.

            Let’s take a closer look at electrifying our crops (not literally electrifying crops) … while, adding solar to our farm land as well as some of the side benefits and challenges it creates.
            Solar panels on farmland, is that what our society needs?
